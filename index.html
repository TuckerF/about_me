          <h1>Introduction</h1>
          <p><b><span id="first-letter">I<span></b><b> am a newly </b> married, aspiring web developer who desires to grow and contribute to the world in a meaningful way during my lifetime. Contributing to the world around me is very important to me and I am both discovering what I have to give to others and how I can apply that to making a differnece in the lives of those around me.</p>

          <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
          <p><span id="first-letter"><b>I</b></span> <b>grew up in</b> Pasadena, California with my twin sister and younger brother. We have a loving family, typical sibiling memories, and great vacations. I cannot remember a time I couldn't look up and see the San Gabriel Mountains looming over me. If I had a mind to travel for a change in scenery the snow was close and the beach was closer and I remember many a beach bonfire when we stayed out late and in connected in our Southern-Californian way.</p>

          <h1>More About Me</h1>
        <p><span id="first-letter"><b>I</b></span> <b>am passionate about</b> transformation. I believe that we all were given a great gift in life and that there is never a lack of opportunity to change grow and better ourselves. I am passionate about truth because without truth I cannot distinguish if I am changing in a posotive or negative way and cannot hope to understand and direct my growth. I am passionate about the giver of truth because He is the only one who can open my eyes to truth. In short without Him I cannot see truth and without truth I am limited in my ability to change for the beter.</p>
